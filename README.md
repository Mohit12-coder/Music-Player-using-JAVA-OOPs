# 🎵 Music Player using Java OOP

This is a simple console-based Music Player project developed in Java using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to create albums, add songs to albums, and manage a custom playlist with operations such as play next, previous, replay, and delete.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Album.java`: Represents a music album that can contain multiple songs. Handles operations like adding a song and adding songs to a playlist.
- `Song.java`: A simple model class representing a song with a title and duration.
- `Main.java`: Contains the main logic for initializing albums, creating a playlist, and controlling playback using a menu-driven system.

## 🚀 Features

- Add songs to albums
- Create playlists from multiple albums
- Navigate through songs (next, previous, replay)
- Print all songs in the playlist
- Delete currently playing song from the playlist

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.
3. Compile and run `Main.java`.
